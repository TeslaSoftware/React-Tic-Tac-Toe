## Description
This is my implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe using React. 
This app has the following features:
- Displaying the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
- Bold currently selected item in the move list.
- Toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
- When someone wins highlighting the three squares that caused the win. When no one wins, displaying a message about the result being a draw.
